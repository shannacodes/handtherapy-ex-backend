# handtherapy-ex-backend
This is the MERN backend for my Hand Ex App.

ABOUT THE HAND EXERCISE APP ___ This App is for occupational therapists and physical therapists (and similar HCP) to generate custom home exercise programs for people with hand and upper extremity issues.

WHY? ___ Many OT/PT clinics still use paper copies to issue home programs for their patients. This method is not ideal for the environment and inefficient. Current digital home exercise programs are geared towards the general PT population. However, this app is intended for upper extremity/hand rehabilitaiton specifically.

CURRENT UPDATE AS OF 10-12-2023: ___ You may be seeing a blank database of exercises at the moment because the current code is utilizing a backend w/ a local db.json file. I am actively working on implementing the MERN stack for my backend. :)
